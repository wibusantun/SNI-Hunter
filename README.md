## AdwanceSNI-2.0
AdwanceSNI 2.0 is the enhanced version of the original AdwanceSNI program, designed to provide a comprehensive suite for network scanning and subdomain discovery. It retains the core functionalities of finding subdomains and scanning hosts while introducing new tools for IP extraction, IP generation, and a lite scanner.


<strong><em>AdwanceSNI 2.0 is built using Ayan Rajput's prebuilt tools ‚Äì bughunter-go, normal scanner, and subdomain discovery (API). These tools handle subdomain discovery and host scanning, forming the core of the project.</em></strong>

<strong><em>Credit goes to Ayan Rajput for his valuable contributionsü§ù.</em></strong>
